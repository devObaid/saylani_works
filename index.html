        <h2> Introduction to git</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from
                small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.</li>
            <li>Git relies on the basis of distributed development of software where more than one developer may have
                access to the source code of a specific application and can modify changes to it that may be seen by
                other developers..</li>
            <li>Initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005.</li>
            <li>Every git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking
                capabilities, independent of network access or a central server.</li>
            <li>Git allows a team of people to work together, all using the same files. It helps the team cope with the
                confusion that tends to happen when multiple people are editing the same files.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Introduction to Github</h2>
        <p>GitHub is an web based platform which hosts software development projects and uses Git for version
            management. Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers to work together on same
            software projects and keep track of changes made to their code by on another. GitHub offers a user-friendly
            interface, which is very collaborative tools, and more project management tools, GitHub will enhance the
            potential of the Git. <br>

            GitHub allows developers to create and manage the code in the repository in the remote location where others
            can aceses the code or Github is an collection repositories which contains the files of the project.</p>

        <h2>Uses Cases Of GitHub</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Version Control:</strong> GitHub is also called an version control system because of it uses such has if the
                certain developers are working on the same project and if any developer make changes at it is effecting
                the entire code then they move back to previous version with immediate actions.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaboration and Code Review:</strong> GitHub allows group of developers work on same project where there can
                review the each others code and can work on the same project which will improve the productivity and
                where they can develop the complex application in faster manner.</li>
            <li><strong>Issue Tracking: </strong> Has an certain group of developers will work on the same project so when the issue
                arises in the GitHub then you can assign the issue to the other developer to whom you want.</li>
            <li><strong>Open Source Development: </strong> The most widely used platform for open source development is GitHub.</li>
        </ul>
